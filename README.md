> **Note:** This is a living pre-release specification subject to minor changes based on implementation feedback and real-world usage. The specification is stable enough for experimental implementations but may undergo adjustments before the final 1.0 release.

## Introduction

The Open Commerce Protocol (OCP) is an open, extensible API specification for digital commerce, enabling universal clients to interact with any compliant serverâ€”from simple product catalogs to complex e-commerce platforms. By leveraging HTTP semantics, capability discovery, and structured metadata, OCP supports physical goods, digital services, and in-store pickup while prioritizing implementer freedom. It integrates the powerful and extensible x402 Protocol for payments. This allows OCP to function as a unified payment gateway, supporting both web3-native assets (like USDC for instant, low-fee blockchain transactions) and traditional fiat currencies (via providers like Stripe and PayPal) through a single, elegant, and stateless API flow.

## Overview & Common Questions

**What is OCP?**  
An open, minimal, and extensible standard for digital commerce. It defines a universal HTTP API for the entire transaction lifecycle: product discovery, cart management, ordering, and real-time updatesâ€”supporting physical goods, digital services, and in-store pickup.

**Why OCP?**
Traditional e-commerce APIs are fragmented and vendor-specific. OCP provides a consistent, extensible framework that adapts to any business modelâ€”from simple catalogs to complex apparel storesâ€”without dictating internal logic. It prioritizes implementer freedom while enabling universal, adaptive clients.

**How does OCP work?**
Clients begin by discovering server capabilities (`GET /capabilities`), then browse catalogs, manage carts, and place orders. Real-time updates stream via Server-Sent Events. Complexity is delegated to structured `metadata` linked to JSON Schemas, allowing clients to adapt dynamically without hardcoding features.

**Why X402 for payments?**  
OCP integrates the [x402 Protocol](https://github.com/coinbase/x402) for web3-native payments, enabling instant, low-fee blockchain transactions with stablecoins like USDC. Unlike credit cards (high fees, slow settlement, chargebacks), X402 supports micropayments, AI agents, and programmable commerce.

**How does authentication work?**  
OCP uses Bearer token authentication (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). Token formats (e.g., JWT, API keys) are implementation-specific and may be discoverable via capabilities. Discovery endpoints are public; others require auth.

**Who is OCP for?**  
API providers monetizing digital commerce, client developers building universal shopping apps, and AI agents requiring autonomous transactions.

The full OpenAPI 3.0 specification is available in [`spec.yaml`](./src/spec.yaml).

<br />

## Getting Started

1. **Review the Specification:** Read the [OpenAPI spec](./src/spec.yaml) for the full API details.
2. **Implement Core Endpoints:** Start with discovery (`/capabilities`, `/stores`, `/catalogs`) and cart/order flows.
3. **Add Capabilities:** Implement optional features like variants or tracking via standard schemas.
4. **Build Clients:** Use capability discovery for adaptive apps compatible with any OCP server.

## Key Features

*   **Universal Commerce Model:** A single, elegant model handles **physical goods**, **digital goods/services**, and **in-store pickup** using a simple `fulfillmentType` flag.
*   **Flexible Checkout Flows:** OCP supports both stateful, multi-step shopping carts for complex journeys and stateless, "Buy Now" checkouts for simple, one-click purchases. This is enabled by the discoverable `dev.ocp.order.direct@1.0` capability, allowing clients to provide the optimal user experience for any scenario.
*   **Dynamic Capability Discovery:** The `GET /capabilities` endpoint allows a client to understand a server's full feature set, enabling truly adaptive applications.
*   **Real-time Order Updates:** A built-in Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint (`/orders/{id}/updates`) provides efficient, real-time order status changes using standardized JSON Patch.
*   **Structured, Extensible Metadata:** Go beyond simple key-value pairs. OCP provides a system for servers to link to official JSON Schemas that define the structure of their `metadata`.
*   **Web3-Native Payments:** Includes a complete, protocol-compliant implementation for handling payments via the [x402 Protocol](https://github.com/coinbase/x402).
*   **Global-Ready by Design:** Full internationalization support is built into the standard. Servers can advertise supported languages and regional formats, allowing clients to provide a fully localized experience, including right-to-left (RTL) language support and culturally correct currency formatting.
*   **Formal Security Model:** Recommends and formalizes a `Bearer` token authentication scheme for all protected resources.

<br />

## A Unified, HTTP-Native Payment Protocol (x402)

OCP integrates the x402 Protocol because it provides a single, open, and stateless pattern for handling any payment flow directly over HTTP. Instead of relying on cumbersome redirects or multiple API calls to manage state, the entire transaction is handled within a simple request/retry cycle.

This is made possible through extensible payment schemes, which allow OCP to support diverse payment rails.

### 1. For Web3-Native Payments (The exact Scheme)

For digital assets, OCP uses the exact scheme to enable payments that are impossible with traditional finance:

- **Micropayments & Pay-Per-Use:** Charge per API call, content access, or item without subscriptions or minimums.
- **Instant Settlement:** Blockchain-based transactions settle in seconds, not days.
- **Low/No Fees:** Near-zero transaction costs compared to legacy rails.
- **AI & Agent Friendly:** Enables autonomous payments by AI agents without human intervention.
- **Programmable:** Direct HTTP integration via the 402 status code, extensible across chains.

### 2. For Traditional Fiat Payments (The fiat_intent Scheme)

For credit cards, bank transfers, and other traditional methods, OCP leverages the fiat_intent scheme to bring order to the chaos of provider-specific APIs.

- **Simplified Client Logic:** The client doesn't need to know the complex, multi-step logic of Stripe's Payment Intents or PayPal's checkouts. It simply follows the server's instructions provided in the 402 response.
- **Server-Driven UI:** The server sends all necessary contextâ€”including display names ("Credit / Debit Card"), icons, and instructionsâ€”allowing the client to build a rich UI dynamically.
- **Secure and Compliant:** The flow is designed for modern, token-based payment processing. Sensitive card details are never exposed to the OCP client or server, ensuring PCI compliance.
- **A Single, Unified Flow:** Developers write one piece of code to handle the x402 402 retry loop, and it will automatically support any fiat provider the server adds in the future.

### How OCP Uses X402

In the OCP order flow:

1. **Client places order** (`POST /orders`).
2. **If payment required:** Server responds with `402 Payment Required`, including x402 payment requirements (amount, asset, network, etc.).
3. **Client authorizes payment:** Signs a blockchain authorization and retries the request with the `X-PAYMENT` header containing the base64-encoded payment payload.
4. **Server verifies & settles:** Forwards to an x402 facilitator for onchain verification and settlement.
5. **Order completes:** Server returns the order details with a `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header confirming the transaction.

This integration supports physical goods (shipping), digital goods (access keys), and in-store pickup, all with web3 payments.

<br />

## Core Concepts

OCP's power lies in **delegating complexity to `metadata` and making it discoverable**.

Core schemas stay leanâ€”no endless optional fields for variants, sizes, or weights. Domain-specific data resides in a generic `metadata` object.

To avoid chaos, `GET /capabilities` provides a "table of contents" for metadata, linking to standardized JSON Schemas. Clients adapt dynamically, creating a system that's simple by default, complex by choice.

<br />

## The OCP Hypermedia Engine: An API That Guides You

In many APIs, the developer's first step is to read the documentation and hardcode a long list of URL paths into their application. The Open Commerce Protocol (OCP) is designed on a more powerful and resilient principle: **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**.

This sounds complex, but the idea is simple: **instead of memorizing paths, your client "discovers" them.** The API itself tells you what you can do next and provides the exact URLs needed to do it.

### Why Work This Way?

This isn't just an academic exercise; it creates a fundamentally better and more robust integration.

#### 1. No More Brittle URLs
If a server needs to evolve its URL structure (e.g., from `/v1/returns` to `/v2/return-requests`), a client that follows links will **never break**. A client with hardcoded URLs would fail instantly. This makes the entire ecosystem more resilient.

#### 2. A Self-Discovering API
Your application learns the API as it uses it. The presence of a link or an action is the signal that a feature is available. This removes guesswork and the need to constantly consult documentation for every endpoint.

#### 3. Dynamic, Context-Aware UIs
The API provides the logic for your UI. Instead of your client code deciding when to show a "Write a Review" button, the API makes the decision. If the action is present in the response, you show the button. If not, you don't.

#### 4. True Server Freedom
OCP doesn't dictate a server's internal architecture. Your returns system can live on a completely different microservice with a different URL structure, and as long as you provide the correct links, any OCP client can use it seamlessly.

### How It Works: Two Types of Discovery

OCP uses two primary mechanisms for this hypermedia-driven discovery.

#### 1. Global Discovery: The `/capabilities` Endpoint

The first thing your client does is ask the server what it's capable of. This is for server-wide features that aren't tied to a specific product or order.

**Example: Discovering Authentication and Search**

A client makes a `GET /capabilities` request and receives the "table of contents" for the API:

```json
{
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "id": "dev.ocp.auth.flows@1.0",
      "metadata": {
        "signInUrl": "https://auth.example.com/login",
        "profileUrl": "https://api.example.com/users/me"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "dev.ocp.product.search@1.0",
      "metadata": {
        "urlTemplate": "https://api.example.com/search?q={query}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

From this single response, your client now knows:
* **How to sign in:** It doesn't need to know the path is `/login`; it just uses the `signInUrl` provided.
* **How to search:** It doesn't need to guess the query parameter is `q`; it uses the `urlTemplate` to construct a valid search request.

#### 2. Contextual Discovery: The `actions` Array

This is the most powerful feature. Core resources like `Order` and `CatalogItem` will tell you what actions you can perform on them *in their current state*.

**Example: A Discoverable Returns Workflow**

1. A user views a recently delivered order. Your client makes a `GET /orders/order_123`.

2. The server checks its business logic. Because the order is within the 30-day return window, it includes an `initiate_return` action in the response:

```json
{
  "id": "order_123",
  "status": "completed",
  "actions": [
    {
      "id": "initiate_return",
      "href": "https://api.example.com/v2/order/order_123/return-requests"
    }
  ],
  "items": [...]
}
```

3. Your client's logic is now incredibly simple:

```javascript
// Pseudo-code for a UI component
const returnAction = order.actions.find(action => action.id === 'initiate_return');

if (returnAction) {
  // The action is present, so we show the button
  showReturnButton({
    // We tell the button exactly which URL to POST to
    onClick: () => postTo(returnAction.href)
  });
}
```

If the same order were 60 days old, the server would simply omit the `initiate_return` action from the `actions` array. The exact same client code would run, find nothing, and the "Return Items" button would never be rendered. The business logic lives on the server, where it belongs, and the client intelligently adapts.

This same pattern is used for:
* **Cancellations:** The `cancel` action only appears if an order is cancellable.
* **Writing Reviews:** The `add_review` action only appears on a `CatalogItem` if the logged-in user has purchased it.

By embracing this hypermedia-driven approach, the Open Commerce Protocol provides a blueprint for a truly modern, resilient, and intelligent commerce ecosystem.

<br />

## Example: A Universal Client Buys a T-Shirt

This narrative demonstrates how a client uses the full power of OCP to interact with an apparel store.

### Step 1: Discover Server Capabilities

The client's first action is to understand the server's features.

**Request:**
`GET /capabilities`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "id": "dev.ocp.product.variants@1.0",
      "schemaUrl": "https://schemas.OCP.dev/product/variants/v1.json"
    },
    {
      "id": "dev.ocp.order.shipment_tracking@1.0",
      "schemaUrl": "https://schemas.OCP.dev/order/shipment_tracking/v1.json"
    }
  ]
}
```
* **Client Insight:** "Okay, this server supports products with variants (like size and color) and will provide shipment tracking details for orders. I can now enable the UI for these features."

### Step 2: View a Product with Structured Metadata

The client fetches a catalog (`/catalogs/{id}`) and gets a product (`CatalogItem`).

**Product Data:**
```json
{
  "id": "prod_123",
  "name": "Classic OCP Tee",
  "price": { "amount": "25.00", "currency": "USD" },
  "fulfillmentType": "physical", // This tells the client to prepare for a shipping address.
  "available": true,
  "metadata": {
    "x-vendor-style-code": "FW25-TEE-01",
    // The key matches the base ID from the capabilities endpoint.
    "dev.ocp.product.variants": {
      "_version": "1.0",
      "options": ["Size", "Color"],
      "variants": [
        {
          "id": "var_large_black", // ID to use when adding to cart.
          "values": ["Large", "Black"],
          "price": { "amount": "25.00", "currency": "USD" },
          "stock": 42
        },
        {
          "id": "var_large_white",
          "values": ["Large", "White"],
          "price": { "amount": "25.00", "currency": "USD" },
          "stock": 0 // This variant is out of stock.
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
* **Client Insight:** The client sees the `dev.ocp.product.variants@1.0` key. It now knows it can confidently parse the data within to build a size/color selection UI and disable the "White" option because its stock is 0.

### Step 3: Place the Order

The user adds `var_large_black` to the cart. During checkout, the client places the order.

**Request:**
`POST /orders`
```json
{
  "cartId": "cart_abc",
  // This field is included because the cart contains a 'physical' item.
  "deliveryAddress": {
    "address": "123 OCP Lane, Protocol City, 1337"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Handle the Unified Payment Flow

The user adds the item to the cart and proceeds to checkout. The client now makes its first attempt to POST /orders. The server, which supports both crypto and fiat, responds with 402 Payment Required, providing both options.

**Server Response (402 Payment Required):**
```json
{
  "x402Version": 1,
  "accepts": [
    {
      "scheme": "fiat_intent",
      "network": "stripe",
      "asset": "USD",
      "maxAmountRequired": "2500",
      "extra": {
        "clientSecret": "pi_3Pq..._secret_XYZ...",
        "displayName": "Credit / Debit Card",
        "inputAction": "Pay $25.00"
      }
    },
    {
      "scheme": "exact",
      "network": "base-sepolia",
      "asset": "0x...",
      "maxAmountRequired": "25000000",
      "extra": {
        "displayName": "Pay with Crypto"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
* **Client Insight:** "The server has given me two payment options. I don't need to know what 'Stripe' is or how blockchain signing works. I will simply render two buttons using the `displayName` for each. If the user clicks the first, I'll use the provided `clientSecret` to launch the Stripe SDK. If they click the second, I'll initiate the crypto signing flow. The server has done all the hard work for me."

The client then retries the `POST /orders` request with the appropriate `X-PAYMENT` header after the user completes one of the flows.

### Step 5: Track the Order in Real-Time

The client immediately opens a connection to the SSE endpoint.

**Request:**
`GET /orders/{orderId}/updates`

**Response Stream:**
```
# --- Order is confirmed ---
# The programmatic state and detailed status are added atomically.
event: order.patch
data: [
  {"op": "replace", "path": "/status", "value": "confirmed"},
  {"op": "add", "path": "/metadata/dev.ocp.order.detailed_status", "value": {
    "_version": "1.0",
    "title": "Order Confirmed",
    "description": "Your order has been confirmed and will be processed soon."
  }}
]

# --- Order is in transit, and a driver is assigned ---
# The core status changes, and two new metadata capabilities are added.
event: order.patch
data: [
  {"op": "replace", "path": "/status", "value": "in_transit"},
  {"op": "replace", "path": "/metadata/dev.ocp.order.detailed_status/title", "value": "Out for Delivery"},
  {"op": "add", "path": "/metadata/dev.ocp.order.delivery_tracking", "value": {
    "_version": "1.0",
    "driver": { "name": "Jane D.", "vehicle": "Blue Sedan" },
    "status": "en_route_to_customer",
    "liveLocation": { "latitude": 40.7135, "longitude": -74.0050 },
    "estimatedArrivalAt": "2025-10-22T19:30:00Z"
  }}
]

# --- Live location is updated moments later ---
# A tiny, efficient patch is sent for only the data that changed.
event: order.patch
data: [{"op": "replace", "path": "/metadata/dev.ocp.order.delivery_tracking/liveLocation", "value": {"latitude": 40.7140, "longitude": -74.0045}}]
```
* **Client Insight:** The client's UI updates the status to "Shipped." Because it saw the `dev.ocp.order.shipment_tracking@1.0` capability in Step 1, it knows to look for the `dev.ocp.order.shipment_tracking` key in the metadata and can now display a "Track Your Shipment" button that links to the `trackingUrl`.

<br />

## Handling Different Commerce Models

OCP is designed to be flexible. Not all transactions are created equal, and the standard provides the tools to handle both complex and simple checkout flows gracefully.

### The Standard Stateful Cart

By default, OCP uses a robust, server-side `Cart` resource. This is the ideal foundation for traditional e-commerce, where users add multiple items, apply promotions, and calculate shipping before committing to a purchase. The server manages the state, ensuring data is always accurate and validated at every step.

### The "Buy Now" Flow (dev.ocp.order.direct@1.0)

For use cases like purchasing a single digital article, re-ordering a meal, or other quick transactions, servers can implement the Direct Order capability. This allows a client to bypass the cart and create an order directly from a list of items.

A client discovers this capability at runtime and can dynamically render both "Add to Cart" and "Buy Now" buttons, providing the perfect, context-aware user experience for any product.

<br />

## Cart vs. Direct Order Discovery

OCP makes cart support and direct order support explicit and discoverable through capabilities. This eliminates guesswork and enables clients to provide the optimal user experience based on what the server supports.

### How It Works

Clients check the `/capabilities` endpoint for two key capabilities:

- **`dev.ocp.cart@1.0`**: Server supports stateful shopping carts with lifecycle policies
- **`dev.ocp.order.direct@1.0`**: Server supports cart-less "Buy Now" orders

### Client Decision Logic

```javascript
// Step 1: Discover capabilities
const capabilities = await fetch('/capabilities').then(r => r.json());
const capIds = capabilities.capabilities.map(c => c.id);

const hasCart = capIds.includes('dev.ocp.cart');
const hasDirect = capIds.includes('dev.ocp.order.direct');

// Step 2: Determine UI based on capabilities
if (!hasCart && !hasDirect) {
  throw new Error('Server supports neither cart nor direct order creation');
}

if (hasCart && hasDirect) {
  // Show both "Add to Cart" AND "Buy Now" buttons
  renderProductPage({
    buttons: ['addToCart', 'buyNow']
  });

  // Get cart policies for UI hints
  const cartCap = capabilities.capabilities.find(c => c.id === 'dev.ocp.cart');
  if (cartCap.metadata?.lifetimeSeconds) {
    showCartExpirationTimer(cartCap.metadata.lifetimeSeconds);
  }
} else if (hasCart) {
  // Traditional cart-only flow
  renderProductPage({ buttons: ['addToCart'] });
} else {
  // Direct-only (minimal cart-less server)
  renderProductPage({ buttons: ['buyNow'] });
}
```

### Why This Matters

- **No Trial-and-Error**: Clients know exactly what endpoints exist without making failing requests
- **Dynamic UI**: Show the right buttons based on server capabilities
- **Cart Policies**: The `dev.ocp.cart` capability metadata includes `lifetimeSeconds`, `maxItems`, and other policies that help clients provide better UX (e.g., showing cart expiration timers)
- **Explicit Design**: Mixing cart and direct order discovery is now explicit, not implicit

<br />

## Error Handling

OCP provides a comprehensive, machine-readable error catalog in the OpenAPI specification that defines every error code's behavior, common causes, and recovery strategies.

### Structured Error Response

All errors follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "code": "cart_expired",
  "message": "Cart expired after 3600 seconds of inactivity",
  "userMessage": {
    "localizationKey": "error.cart.expired",
    "params": { "lifetimeSeconds": 3600 }
  },
  "nextActions": [
    {
      "id": "create_new_cart",
      "href": "/carts",
      "method": "POST"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Common Error Patterns

#### Cart Expiration (410 Gone)

When a cart expires due to inactivity:

```javascript
try {
  await createOrder({ cartId });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'cart_expired') {
    // Persist items locally
    const items = getCurrentCartItems();
    localStorage.setItem('pendingCartItems', JSON.stringify(items));

    // Recreate cart
    const newCart = await createCart({ storeId });
    for (const item of items) {
      await addToCart(newCart.id, item);
    }

    // Retry order
    return createOrder({ cartId: newCart.id });
  }
}
```

**Prevention**: Check the `dev.ocp.cart` capability's `metadata.lifetimeSeconds` and ensure cart updates happen before expiration.

#### Cart Not Found (404 Not Found)

The cart may have been converted to an order:

```javascript
if (error.code === 'cart_not_found') {
  // Check if cart became an order
  const orders = await fetch('/orders').then(r => r.json());
  const recentOrder = orders.orders.find(o => o.createdAt > lastCartUpdate);

  if (recentOrder) {
    // Navigate to order page
    navigateTo(`/orders/${recentOrder.id}`);
  } else {
    // Create new cart
    createNewCart();
  }
}
```

### Full Error Catalog

The complete error catalog with HTTP status codes, retry strategies, common causes, and recovery actions is available in the `x-error-catalog` section of [`spec.yaml`](./src/spec.yaml).

## Versioning Rules

OCP uses semantic versioning for capabilities and the overall standard.

- **PATCH (1.0 â†’ 1.1):** Add optional fields, no breaking changes. Clients can safely upgrade without changes.
- **MINOR (1.x â†’ 2.0):** Breaking changes allowed, must provide migration guide. Servers announce deprecation 3 months in advance.
- **Deprecation:** Servers must support old versions for at least 12 months after sunset announcement.

Clients negotiate versions via the `Accept-OCP-Capabilities` header (comma-separated list of capability IDs with versions, e.g., `dev.ocp.product.variants@2.0`). If omitted, servers use default versions.

For detailed versioning strategy, multi-version support, client negotiation, deprecation policies, and migration examples, see the **[Capability Versioning Guide](./docs/capability-versioning.md)**.

## Future Direction

OCP is a living standard. The future direction includes:
*   **Developing official Client SDKs and Server Middleware:** Building high-quality, open-source libraries that make implementing OCP trivial for both client and server developers.
*   **Expanding the Capability Library:** Adding new standard schemas for emerging commerce concepts like subscriptions, bookings, and advanced personalization.
*   **Formalizing a Community Governance Model:** Establishing processes for proposing, reviewing, and adopting new capabilities to ensure the standard evolves responsibly.
*   **Alternative Transport Layers:** Exploring implementations over transports beyond HTTP, such as asynchronous message queues or other protocols.

<br />

## Implementation Notes

- **Always discover capabilities first:** Call `GET /capabilities` to adapt dynamicallyâ€”never hardcode features.
- **Use full Capability IDs as metadata keys:** E.g., `"dev.ocp.product.variants@1.0"` to link to schemas.
- **Handle missing capabilities gracefully:** Fall back to basic representations if optional features aren't supported.
- **Require idempotency:** Include `Idempotency-Key` header in all state-changing requests (POST, PATCH, DELETE) to prevent duplicates. Servers store keys for 24 hours minimum.
- **Support all fulfillment types:** Design checkout for `physical` (shipping), `digital`, and `pickup` items in any cart.

## Quick Reference

| Endpoint | Verb | Description | Auth |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/capabilities` | `GET` | **Discover server features and metadata schemas.** | No |
| `/stores` | `GET` | List available vendors/stores. | No |
| `/catalogs` | `GET` | List available catalogs. | No |
| `/catalogs/{id}` | `GET` | Get a full product catalog. | No |
| `/carts` | `POST` | Create a new shopping cart. | Yes |
| `/carts/{id}` | `GET` | Get a cart by ID. | Yes |
| `/carts/{id}/items` | `POST` | Add an item to the cart. | Yes |
| `/carts/{id}/items/{itemId}` | `PATCH`/`DELETE` | Update or remove an item. | Yes |
| `/orders` | `POST` | Place an order from a cart. Order type is inferred from cart contents. May return 402 if payment is required. | Yes |
| `/orders/{id}` | `GET` | Get the current state of an order. | Yes |
| `/orders/{id}/updates` | `GET` | **Subscribe to real-time order updates via SSE.** | Yes |
| `/orders/{id}/cancel` | `POST` | Request to cancel an order. | Yes |
| `/carts/{cartId}/promotions` | `POST` | Apply or validate a promotion on a cart. | Yes |

<br />

## Content Type

All API requests and responses use the custom media type `application/ocp+json; version=1.0`. Clients should set the `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers accordingly:

```
Accept: application/ocp+json; version=1.0
Content-Type: application/ocp+json; version=1.0
```

<br />

## Pagination

List endpoints (`GET /stores`, `GET /catalogs`, `GET /orders`) return paginated responses using cursor-based pagination.

### Request

```http
GET /stores?limit=20&cursor=eyJpZCI6InN0b3JlXzIwIn0
```

### Response

```json
{
  "stores": [
    { "id": "store_1", "name": "Store 1", ... }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 20,
    "nextCursor": "eyJpZCI6InN0b3JlXzQwIn0",
    "previousCursor": null,
    "totalCount": 157
  }
}
```

### Client Usage

```javascript
let cursor = null;
const allStores = [];

do {
  const url = `/stores?limit=20${cursor ? `&cursor=${cursor}` : ''}`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const data = await response.json();

  allStores.push(...data.stores);
  cursor = data.pagination.nextCursor;
} while (cursor);
```

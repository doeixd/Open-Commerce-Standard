standard json schema for food delivery orders.

A standard JSON schema for food delivery orders typically includes key properties such as order identifiers, date, items, prices, and customer details. The schema can be based on industry standards and example implementations commonly seen in APIs for food delivery platforms.

Example JSON Schema Structure
Below is a generalized example of what a JSON schema for a food delivery order may look like, inspired by practical and public implementations:

json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "order_id": { "type": "string" },
    "date": { "type": "string", "format": "date" },
    "customer": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": { "type": "string" },
        "address": { "type": "string" }
      }
    },
    "items": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "dish_id": { "type": "string" },
          "name": { "type": "string" },
          "quantity": { "type": "string" },
          "price": { "type": "number" }
        },
        "required": ["dish_id", "name", "quantity", "price"]
      }
    },
    "total_price": { "type": "number" },
    "status": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["order_id", "date", "customer", "items", "total_price", "status"]
}
A typical JSON example returned by a food delivery API may look like this:

json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "order_id": "4252",
    "date": "2020-12-06",
    "items": [
      {
        "dish_id": "45271",
        "name": "Mexican Burrito",
        "quantity": "2x",
        "price": 5.99
      },
      {
        "dish_id": "22331",
        "name": "Enchilada",
        "quantity": "1x",
        "price": 3.99
      }
    ],
    "total_price": 12.98
  }
}
This schema allows for scalable adaptation to integrations with platforms like Uber Eats or by following conventions from widely-used standards such as schema.org’s Order specification.​

Additional Standard Fields
Delivery address and contact details

Payment method and transaction status

Optional delivery instructions and estimated times

Industry API specifications, like Open Delivery or schema.org's Order type, offer extensible models to accommodate more complex business requirements. The JSON schema above provides a practical template to begin standard implementations for food delivery orders.​

does one exist?

There is no single universal JSON schema standard specifically for food delivery orders. However, there are recognized structured data and open API standards that serve as de facto models for interoperability across delivery platforms.

Existing Standards and Models
Schema.org’s Order Type
The most widely recognized generic model for representing orders is the Order type from schema.org. It defines properties for orders including identifier, customer, ordered items, delivery, and payment information. It can be extended to represent food delivery order details by linking to FoodEstablishment and MenuItem schema types.​

Open Delivery Standard (Abrasel, Brazil)
The Open Delivery API (versions 1.0–1.2) defines a standardized JSON schema for restaurant orders, deliveries, and menu management. It includes order status, payment method, customer data, and itemized details. This specification is the closest thing to an official JSON schema standard for food delivery orders in production use, with international adoption growing among delivery services.​

Platform-specific JSON schemas
Large food delivery companies (such as Uber Eats or DoorDash) and vendors like Oracle Simphony expose proprietary JSON schemas for their APIs, used internally and by partners for integration. These schemas are not standardized but tend to follow similar patterns derived from schema.org or open delivery standards.​

Summary
Type	Maintainer	Scope	JSON Schema Status
Schema.org Order	Schema.org (Google, Microsoft, etc.)	General e-commerce orders	Conceptual structure, not a strict JSON schema ​
Open Delivery API	Abrasel (Brazil)	Restaurant and food delivery	Defined JSON schemas (official) ​
Uber Eats / Simphony	Private vendors	Specific to platform	Proprietary JSON schema ​
In short, a universal standard does not exist, but Open Delivery API is currently the most formal JSON schema specification for food delivery orders in use internationally.open standard for restaurant ordering

There is currently no single global open standard specifically dedicated to restaurant ordering, but multiple open protocols and interoperable frameworks are being adopted or proposed to unify restaurant order management across platforms and vendors.

Key Emerging Standards and Frameworks
OpenAPI & RESTful Standards
Most modern restaurant ordering systems use open APIs conforming to OpenAPI specifications, allowing interoperability between different POS, delivery, and payment systems. This ensures that a third-party app (e.g., DoorDash or Uber Eats) can interact with a restaurant’s POS in a standardized way.​

Open Ordering via Olo & RACS
The Restaurant Aggregator Commission Standard (RACS)—initially developed by Olo—defines open protocols for integrating restaurant POS systems with multiple delivery aggregators. The goal is to make the ordering experience consistent and transparent across providers.​

GS1 Standards
GS1 digital identifiers (used in supply chains) are being extended to restaurant menu items and ingredients, which indirectly supports open restaurant data exchange. It allows standardized data formatting for allergens, nutrition, and portion specifications, making ordering systems interoperable.​

OpenPOS & OpenEPOS Compatibility
OpenPOS is an open-source architecture for point-of-sale systems used in restaurants. It supports modular plug-ins for online ordering, loyalty programs, and mobile payments. Systems compliant with OpenPOS can integrate with multiple channels using open connectors.​

Schema.org & Menu Data Standards
For menu representation, some platforms follow Schema.org/Restaurant and MenuItem structured data standards. These allow online menus to be universally readable by search engines, ordering apps, and AI assistants, establishing an “open semantic layer” for restaurant menus.​

Summary Table
Standard / Framework	Focus Area	Description	Adoption
OpenAPI	APIs / Integration	Defines a universal API interface for restaurant systems	Widely used by POS vendors
Olo RACS	Delivery Aggregation	Standardized aggregator commission and integration	Large chains in North America
GS1 Digital Standards	Supply Data	Identifiers for ingredients and nutritional metadata	Global adoption in food supply
OpenPOS	POS Interoperability	Open-source POS architecture	Growing in independent restaurants
Schema.org/Menu	Menu Data	Structured markup for menus and items	Common in online menus
In essence, the restaurant industry’s open standard for ordering is evolving as a set of interoperable frameworks—mostly based on OpenAPI, Schema.org, GS1, and POS integration protocols—rather than a single unified standard.

GS1 Standards GS1 digital identifiers (used in supply chains) are being extended to restaurant menu items
explain

GS1 standards use digital identifiers such as the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) to uniquely identify products, including restaurant menu items and ingredients. These identifiers are encoded in barcodes or QR codes that can be scanned at various points in the supply chain and at the point of sale. The system extends beyond simple product IDs to include additional data like batch or lot numbers, production and expiration dates, and serial numbers, which are critical for traceability, inventory management, and food safety in the restaurant industry.

The GS1 Digital Link technology further enhances this by converting these identifiers into web-enabled URLs. This means scanning a GS1 Digital Link barcode on a restaurant menu item links directly to detailed online information such as ingredients, allergen info, sourcing, recall status, or nutritional details. It effectively connects the physical restaurant product with rich digital data, enabling better transparency, operational efficiencies, and consumer engagement.

Implementation involves setting up barcode data policies that allow scanning systems to interpret multi-value barcodes containing several data points in a single scan, aiding accuracy in receiving, tracking, and serving food items. This standardization helps restaurants with consistent menu item identification, order accuracy, and supply chain traceability while enhancing consumer trust through transparent information access.​

How would GS1 Digital Link map to restaurant menu item data

GS1 Digital Link maps to restaurant menu item data by transforming the unique product identifiers like GTINs (Global Trade Item Numbers) of menu items into web-enabled URLs, effectively creating a "digital twin" of each item. When a GS1 Digital Link barcode (such as a QR code) on a menu item is scanned, it directs the user to a web resource containing detailed and dynamic information about that specific item.

This information can include:

Ingredient lists and allergen details

Nutritional facts in compliance with regulations

Production or sourcing data tracing the item's supply chain journey

Expiration or best-before dates for perishable items

Related recipes, sustainability credentials, and quality certifications

Recall status and safety information

The GS1 Digital Link can also encapsulate additional attributes and qualifiers, such as batch numbers or variant details (e.g., size, flavor), ensuring precise product identification. For restaurants, this means each menu item can have a unique, standardized digital identity accessible to consumers and staff, facilitating transparency, traceability, enhanced customer engagement, and compliance with food safety laws.

The URI structure supports key-value pairs indicating various data points, making it highly flexible for dynamic content delivery. For example, a link might look like https://id.gs1.org/01/9506000134352?linkType=recipeInfo to access a specific recipe or https://id.gs1.org/01/9506000134352?bestBefore=20251025 for fresh item expiration data.

This mapping enables restaurants to provide rich, up-to-date product data seamlessly to consumers and supply chain partners through a single standardized code on menus, packaging, or even digital ordering platforms, fostering trust and operational efficiency.​

how can a resturant get started with this?

To get started with GS1 Digital Link for a restaurant, the restaurant should follow these steps:

Register with GS1: The restaurant or its food suppliers must obtain GS1 identifiers such as GTINs (Global Trade Item Numbers) by registering with a local GS1 organization. These identifiers uniquely represent each menu item or ingredient.

Develop Digital Product Information: Create detailed, accurate digital content for each menu item to be linked with the GS1 Digital Link. This can include ingredient lists, allergen information, nutritional data, sourcing details, and preparation instructions hosted on a website or digital platform.

Generate GS1 Digital Link Codes: Convert the GS1 identifiers into GS1 Digital Link URIs, embedding multiple attributes (like batch, expiration, allergen info). These URIs can then be encoded into 2D barcodes (e.g., QR codes) or embedded in NFC tags that customers and staff can scan.

Integrate with Existing Systems: Incorporate GS1 Digital Link scanning and decoding into POS, inventory, and ordering systems. This allows for enhanced traceability, menu updates, compliance, and customer engagement.

Pilot and Scale Up: Start with key menu items and test the scanning, linking, and data retrieval process. Use consumer feedback and operational data to expand the adoption and add richer content or new link types (e.g., recipe info, recall status).

Use Available Resources and Tools: Leverage GS1 US implementation guides, compliance checklists, and technology partners that offer platforms for generating and managing GS1 Digital Link codes.

This approach allows incremental adoption where initial implementation can start simply with product info redirection and later scale to full item-level traceability and interactive consumer experiences without re-labeling or systemic disruption.

Early planning is recommended due to the complexity of data management and integration, with many organizations needing 18-24 months to reach full digital link deployment. Support from GS1 organizations and certified solution providers can guide restaurants through this transformation effectively.​
